# Food Forecasting

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project on **Food Demand Forecasting**, aimed at analyzing historical food sales data to identify trends and predict future demand. By leveraging data science techniques, this project helps businesses in the food industry:

- **Anticipate future demand** to optimize procurement and inventory.
- **Reduce food waste** and improve operational efficiency.
- **Enhance profitability** through data-driven decision-making.

The project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebook for **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning-based forecasting models** to generate accurate demand predictions.

## Features
### **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualizing trends and seasonality in food sales.
- Identifying key demand factors and correlations.
- Understanding store- or region-specific patterns.

### **Feature Engineering**
- Creating derived variables to enhance model performance.
- Identifying lag features and rolling aggregates for time-series forecasting.

### **Machine Learning Models**
- **Time Series Analysis** (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
- **Supervised Learning Models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAPE, and R² score for model performance assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Date** – Time dimension for sales analysis.
- **Food Category** – Type of food product.
- **Sales Volume** – Number of units sold.
- **Store/Region Details** – Information on location-specific sales trends.

The data has been preprocessed within the notebook, and all steps are detailed in the **EDA section**.
